              I'm going to improvise. Listen, there's something you should know about me...
              about inception. An idea is like a virus, resilient, highly contagious.

              Well, because he thought it was good sport. Because some men aren’t looking for anything logical, like money. They can’t be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.
